4 Startup sequence
Once the device is powered up, it automatically downloads the calibration coefficients from 
the embedded flash to the internal registers. When the boot procedure is completed, i.e. 
after approximately 5 milliseconds, the device automatically enters power-down mode. To 
turn on the device and gather acceleration data, select the HR bit in CTRL_REG4 and the 
LPen bit in CTRL_REG1, enable at least one of the axes and select the preferred ODR.
The following general-purpose sequence can be used to configure the device:
1. Write CTRL_REG1
2. Write CTRL_REG2
3. Write CTRL_REG3
4. Write CTRL_REG4
5. Write CTRL_REG5
6. Write CTRL_REG6
7. Write REFERENCE
8. Write INTx_THS
9. Write INTx_DUR
10. Write INTx_CFG
11. Write CTRL_REG5


4.1 Reading acceleration data
4.1.1 Using the status register
The LIS3DH generates data serially (X first, Y second, Z third). Every time the single-axis 
data is generated, the corresponding DA signal (XDA, YDA, ZDA) bit of STATUS_REG is 
set to 1. XDA, YDA, ZDA are individually reset to 0 when the respective higher part of the 
data is read (ie. XDA goes to 0 as soon as the X-axis higher part of the data (reg. 29h) is 
read, and so on).
The ZYXDA signal can be set only after Z data generation and is set if XDA, YDA and ZDA 
bits are simultaneously '1', otherwise the ZYXDA bit is reset to '0' when XDA, YDA and 
ZDA are simultaneously '0'.
The overrun flags XOR, YOR, ZOR bits are individually set to '1' when the corresponding 
data is generated and the corresponding DA bit is already at 1, while they are reset to '0' 
(with corresponding DA bit) when the corresponding data is read. 
The ZYXOR bit is set to 1 when at least one overrun flag ( XOR, YOR, ZOR) goes to 1, 
while the ZYXOR bit is reset to 0 when all the overrun flags are zero


The device is provided with a STATUS_REG which should be polled to check when a new 
set of data is available. The reading procedure should be the following:
1. Read STATUS_REG
2. If STATUS_REG(3) = 0, then go to 1
3. If STATUS_REG(7) = 1, then some data have been overwritten
4. Read OUTX_L
5. Read OUTX_H
6. Read OUTY_L
7. Read OUTY_H
8. Read OUTZ_L
9. Read OUTZ_H
10. Data processing
11. Go to 1


Using the data-ready (DRDY) signal
ZYXDA can be driven to the INT1 pin when the I1_ ZYXDA bit of CTRL_REG3 (22h) is set 
to '1'.
This signal is called DRDY. DRDY signal behavior is the same as that of the ZYXDA bit 
(Figure 2: "DRDY signal synchronization"






Inertial interrupt
The LIS3DH can provide two inertial interrupt signals and offers several possibilities to 
personalize these signals. The registers involved in the interrupt generation behavior are 
INTx_CFG, INTx_THS and INTx_DURATION.
Table 17: Interrupt mode configuration
AOI 6D Interrupt mode
0 0 OR combination of interrupt events
0 1 6-direction movement recognition
1 0 AND combination of interrupt events
1 1 6-direction position recognition
Whenever an interrupt condition is verified, the interrupt signal is generated and by reading 
the INTx_SRC register, it is possible to understand which condition happened
